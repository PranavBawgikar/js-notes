## Execution Context
Everything in JavaScript happens inside an Execution Context. When we normally run our JavaScript code, behind the scenes, a 'Global Execution Context' is created which consists of two components inside it. First is Memory where all the variables and functions are stored as a `key: value` pair. For example, `a: 10`, `function: {...}`. <br />
It is also known as Variable Environment. The second component is the Code Component or also known as the Thread of Execution. This is the place where the code is executed one line at a time. Remember, the EC is created in two phases - Memory Creation (a very critical phase) and Code Execution phase. <br />
Function in JavaScript, behave a bit differently when compared to any other programming language. In JavaScript, when a function is invoked, an altogether new EC is created. This new EC is created in the second phase (Code Execution phase) as discussed above. Similar to our 'Global EC', this new one also consists of the same two components. When the execution work of the invoked function is completed, the EC created for that particular function will be deleted.
